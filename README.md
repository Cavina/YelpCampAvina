# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and various other technologies. It allows users to create, rate, and review campgrounds. The project is based on Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy.
The application is hosted by OnRender, and may take a minute to spin up the cluster if you are the first visitor in a bit.
